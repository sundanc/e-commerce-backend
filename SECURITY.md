# Security Implementation in E-commerce Backend

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the e-commerce backend application.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT-based Authentication
- **Token-based Authentication**: Implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens have a configurable expiration time (default: 60 minutes).
- **Secure Token Storage**: Tokens are designed to be stored securely by clients, not in cookies.
- **Token Validation**: Each protected endpoint validates the token's signature and expiration.

### Role-based Access Control
- **User Roles**: System supports regular users and administrators.
- **Permission Checks**: Admin-only endpoints (`/api/admin/*`) verify admin status through the `get_current_active_admin` dependency.
- **Resource Access Controls**: Users can only access their own data (orders, cart, etc.).

## Password Security

- **Password Hashing**: All passwords are hashed using bcrypt algorithm.
- **No Plain-text Storage**: Passwords are never stored in plain text.
- **Password Complexity**: Username validators ensure basic security requirements.
- **Secure Password Reset**: (Planned for future implementation)

## Data Protection

- **HTTPS Support**: API designed to be served over HTTPS in production.
- **Payment Data Security**: No storage of sensitive payment data, only references (payment IDs).
- **Response Data Filtering**: Sensitive information is filtered out from API responses.

## Input Validation

- **Schema Validation**: All input data is validated through Pydantic schemas.
- **Custom Validators**: Custom validation rules for:
  - Email format using `email-validator`
  - Username format (alphanumeric only)
  - Price (must be positive)
  - Stock quantities (non-negative)

## API Security

- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing is configured (can be restricted to specific origins in production).
- **Rate Limiting**: (Recommended for production implementation)
- **HTTP Method Restrictions**: Endpoints respond only to their designated HTTP methods.
- **OAuth2 Password Flow**: Secure password-based authentication.
- **WWW-Authenticate Headers**: Proper authentication headers for standards compliance.
- **Error Information Limitation**: Error responses are informative but don't leak implementation details.

## Environment Variable Security

- **Secret Key Management**: Application secrets (API keys, database URLs, JWT secret) should be stored securely, ideally outside the codebase.
- **Environment Variable Separation**: Different environments (dev/prod) must use different variables and secrets.
- **Example File**: Sensitive information is excluded from `.env.example` file.
- **Docker Secrets**: For production Docker deployments, prefer using Docker Secrets over plain environment variables to manage sensitive configuration like database passwords and API keys.

## Database Security

- **Parameterized Queries**: SQLAlchemy ORM protects against SQL injection.
- **DB Access Limitation**: Database accessed through dependency injection with restricted scope.
- **Soft Deletion**: Sensitive data is soft-deleted to maintain referential integrity.
- **Race Condition Awareness**: Identified potential race conditions in stock updates during concurrent order processing. Recommended using atomic database operations or locking mechanisms for production robustness.

## Payment Integration Security

- **Stripe API Security**: Integrated with secure Stripe API for payment processing.
- **Payment API Keys**: API keys are stored in environment variables, not in code.
- **Local Development Safety**: Mock payment processing when API keys aren't available.
- **Background Processing**: Sensitive payment operations processed in background tasks.
- **Webhook Security**: Requires proper configuration of webhook secrets and signature verification to prevent unauthorized updates.

## Container Security

- **Dockerfile Best Practices**: The application container runs as a non-root user (`appuser`) to minimize potential damage if the application is compromised.
- **Secure Base Image**: Uses an official Python slim image. Regularly update the base image.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regularly scan container images and application dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `pip-audit`, `safety`, Trivy, or Snyk.

## Additional Best Practices

- **Security Headers**: Properly configured authentication headers.
- **Code Structure**: Secure code organization with proper separation of concerns.
- **Dependency Management**: Package versions are pinned in `requirements.txt`. Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- **Input Sanitization**: Implemented through Pydantic's validation system.
- **Admin Interface Protection**: Admin functionality is protected by role checks, not just URL obscurity.
- **Audit Logging**: Basic audit logging implemented for key security events. **Caution**: Ensure logs do not inadvertently contain sensitive information like passwords, full tokens, or excessive PII. Sensitive data should be masked or omitted from logs.

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for authentication and API endpoints.
2. **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular security testing.
3. **Audit Logging**: Add comprehensive logging for security events.
4. **HTTPS Only**: Force HTTPS connections in production.
5. **CORS Restrictions**: Limit CORS to specific, trusted origins.
6. **Security Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for suspicious activities.
7. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies and base container images updated for security patches. Implement automated dependency scanning.
8. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Add 2FA for sensitive operations (especially admin login).
9. **Webhook Secret Management**: Securely manage and rotate Stripe webhook secrets.
10. **Atomic Operations**: Implement atomic updates or locking for critical concurrent operations like stock management.
11. **Run as Non-Root**: Ensure containerized applications run as non-root users.
12. **Use Docker Secrets**: Manage sensitive configuration in Docker using secrets instead of environment variables.
13. **Review Logging**: Carefully review all log outputs to ensure no sensitive data is being exposed. Implement log masking where necessary.
